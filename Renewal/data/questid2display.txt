7421#That's enough#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
While working on various jobs, Kardui's page reached me. Must go and meet Kardui. His office will be on the top floor when following the spiral road.#
Talking with Kardui#

7422#Kardui's gift#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kardui stated that he prepared a gift that can be picked up from Chief of Staff Shenime. What could it be..#
Receiving the gift through Shenime#

7423#A rumor about the King 1#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
During the conversation with Leo, unsettling things about Kardui were told. He didn't seem to get into the details but it was very concerning.#
#

7424#A rumor about the King 2#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Fome shared something unexpected. It was that Lapines have been subtly disliking Kardui. This was similar to what Leo seemed to keep to himself before.#
#

7425#A rumor about the King 3#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Connection between Cenes's despotism and Kardui was made through talking with the Lapines. It is not too serious, but it is certain that the current king Kardui is being considered in a way similar to how Cenes was.#
#

7426#A rumor about the King 4#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Most recently, Kardui seemed to have become Mayor Jun in the midst of the calamity facing the entire Lapine race. They don't seem to completely disagree with his policies, but they don't seem to agree with them either.#
#

7427#At times like this, face it straight on!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The truth behind Lapine's anxiety and fear toward Kardui could no longer be elucidated. Shouldn't this at least be communicated to the individual of interest? It might be possible to hear about the reason behind it all..#
Talk with Kardui#

7428#Yai of the wild#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Obtain items for the Yai for the Eclage guard Minuel who stands post every day and night.#

The items collected by Minuel seemed to have created a sensation among the Yai decorations. Let's obtain the times regularly to keep the trend going.#
Check with Minuel after some time#

7432#The troublemakers in the land of blooming flowers#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Let's show who's boss to Menblatt and Petals that annoy travelers. It's reported as patrolling, but it's actually elimination.#
Eliminating Menblatt and Petals#

7433#Need constant guidance#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Leo once again asks to patrol and subjugate the Menblatt and Petals. Let's check with him later.#

7434#Kardui's big brother#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Kardui sends a letter to his big brother. Kardui's brother lives on the top flower of Biforst Tower. Let's deliver it to him.#
Deliver the letter#

7435#Time for reading the letter#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hisie asked for some time to read the letter. It only takes a couple of minutes, so let's wait a bit.#
Wait until he is done reading the letter#

7436#Avant the Scholar of Magics#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
In Kardui's letter, there was not only an introduction but also a request to look for his father, Avant the Scholar of Magics. Help Hisie to find out more about the scholar from within Eclage.#
#

7437#Shenime's favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Could not obtain Avant's info but instead got a strange request from Shenime. Asked to gather experimental ingredients for the scholar of magics he sponsors. They are 10 Dust Balls, 10 Leaf Bookmarks.#
10 Dust Balls, 10 Leaf Bookmarks#

7438#Secret sponsorship#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Shenime did not share even a bit about the scholar of magics he sponsors, and asks to forget about even finding out about it. Is there anyone that knows?#
Search for information#

7439#The scholar of magics sponsored by Shenime#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hisie stated that if you track down Shenime, the location of the scholar might be identified as well. Find out Shenime's duties.#
Search for information#

7440#Minuel's witness#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Eclage guard Minuel stated that Shenime often travels east, in the opposite direction from his Yai. Discuss with Hisie.#
Talk with Hisie#

7441#Mail is here!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Planned to visit the scholar of magic's Yai as if Shenime is sending a mail. Hisie will confirm whether that person is Avant. Hisie will provide the information at the crossroads in front of Eclage.#
10 Dustballs, 10 Leaf Bookmarks#

7442#The identity of the scholar of magics#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scholar of magics found through the strategy was indeed Avant. Must tell this to Kardui.#
Talk with Kardui#

7443#Interfere with the research!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
A small revenge. Kardui and Hisie want to know what Avant is researching and want to interfere it. Could this be a small revenge of the brothers?#
Interfereing Avant's research#

7444#What Avant was researching#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Avant was researching on the methods to extract the Orb's magic power. Since this is dangerous information, the research materials should immediately be returned to Kardui.#
Deliver the research materials to Kardui#

7445#Avant's back#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Researched the force behind Avant's research on the Orb. The most likely culpril is Avant's sponsor, the chief of staff. Approach the chief of staff to reveal the truth.#
Talk with the chief of staff#

7446#Unfruitful conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Talked with Shenime the chief of staff, but nothing was gained. He states that he might also have been tricked by Avant. The chief of staff was actually upset that Kardui only increased the defenses surrounding the Orb.#
Report to Kardui#

7447#Dilemma surrounding the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Only confirmed the distrust toward Kardui's instead of revealing more about Avant's research. The chief of staff hoped that Kardui's judgment has not weakened, and asked that he would demonstrate it.#
Report to Kardui#

7448#Something's not right#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
After discussing with Kardui and Hisie, it is decided that the chief of staff is indeed the most suspicious. What is the reason behind his resistance toward Kardui's actions toward the Orb?#
Surveillance of the chief of staff#

7449#Temptation toward the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The chief of staff asked to go to the Orb's lighting room to discuss it. I decided to let Kardui know about this after telling him to give me some time to think about it.#
Report to Kardui#

7450#Orb's lighting room#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Not sure why the chief of staff kept trying to lure me into the Orb's lighting room, but decided to go there even just to figure out why. Let's go along with what he wants for now.#
Hold hands with the chief of staff#

7451#Betrayal#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Everything is so confusing. The monster battled in the lighting room was not a subordinate of the King of Demons. They controlled me without my knowledge. Shenime the chief of staff betrayed all!#
Report to Kardui#

7452#Find the chief of staff!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Shenime the chief of staff, who was responsible for all these occurrences, has hidden his whereabouts. According to Hisie's sources, residual magic force was faintly felt in Bifrost.#
Survey Northern Bifrost#

7453#The last of the chief of staff#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The road from the north to the south in Bifrost. It used to be an open path but is currently blocked by a huge rift in the south. On the way to the rift, the chief of staff's corpse was found.#

8017#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto has asked you to help him inspect the machines in the factory one at a time to know which one needs to be fixed. Find the 2nd control panel and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8018#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the 2nd control panel and it is completely broken. Report this back to Zelmeto.#
#

8019#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect the automatic pressure governors and to report any problems no matter how small they may seem.#
#

8020#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the automatic pressure governors and after checking more carefully, you find that it's making strange grinding noises and a few of the surface screws are loose. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8021#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now Zelmeto asked you to inspect another control panel. It's similar to the first one but bigger. It's located in the middle of the factory. Find it and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8022#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The main control panel doesn't look like it has any problems. But after tapping on its surface, you hear a disheartening hollow sound. It looks like it's missing some parts... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8023#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect a mechanical hand that transports small objects. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8024#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The conveyor's movements look jittery and clumsy. The mechanical arm also doesn't look powerful enough to bear the loads that it's carrying... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8025#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now you must inspect a pipe located near the large cauldrons of molten metal and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8026#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The pipe you found is bloated and worn out from long durations of being overloaded with pressure. It's a wonder it hasn't exploded yet. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8027#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The final thing Zelmeto has asked you to inspect is a bigger and more powerful conveyor. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8028#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This last conveyor seems to have similar problems to its smaller version. Its movements are awkward, erratic and weak, and almost all of its screws are rusted. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8029#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto tells you that he needs to request an increase in the Factory Repair budget from the superintendant to make sure they have enough materials for the repairs. Find the superintendant.#
#

8030#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The superintendant refused to approve the increase in the Factory Repair budget. You'd better report the bad news to Zelmeto.#
#

8031#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto still wants to make the repairs so he has asked you to bring back ^FF000020 Flexible Tube^000000, ^FF000010 Rusty Screw^000000, and ^FF000010 Used Iron Plate^000000 so they can make the needed repairs.#

Those calluses...! Only a master of the Bash skill has those kinds of hands. Great work, Swordman. I'm very impressed.#
Listen to Shurank's Lecture#

8215#Shurank's Lecture#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
By now, I believe that you know enough about the Increase HP Recovery skill. Next time, I shall teach you what I know about the Provoke skill.#
Listen to Shurank's Lecture#

8216#Shurank's Order#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I wish for you to find a Knight named ^5D478BDequ'ee^000000 in ^5D478BGeffen^000000. Listen carefully, this is the message: ^0000FFWhat happened to the murderer? ^0000FFDid you find out who he is? If you did, what are we supposed to do now?^000000#
Deliver Shurank's message to Dequ'ee in Geffen#

8217#Dequ'ee's Message#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
So Shurank is asking, "What happened to the murderer? Did you find out who he is? If you did, what are we supposed to do now?" We haven't found out who the murderer is for sure. However, we have a list of suspects and we'll figure it out soon.?#
Deliver Dequ'ee's message to Shurank in Izlude#

8218#Shurank's Lecture#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You haven't learned Provoke yet? Now I ask that you train yourself in the use of Provoke.#
Master the skill, Provoke, and return to Shurank#

8219#Shurank's Lecture#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Hm. You seem to have a basic understanding of Provoke, but let me give you a few details so that you can better understand the use of that skill.#
Master the skill, Provoke, and return to Shurank#

8220#Shurank's Lecture#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ah, I see that you have a fairly good understanding of the Provoke skill. Next time we speak, I will tell you what I know about the ^5D478BEndure^000000 skill. When you're ready to learn, come back to me.#
Listen to Shurank's Lecture#

8221#Shurank's Lecture#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Activating Endure enables you to shrug off attacks. You'll receive damage, but enemy attacks will not impede you as much. This means you can counter enemy attacks or escape if you need to. Alright. Now I want you to train in the use of the Endure skill. You can become a great Swordman.#
Master the skill, Endure, and return to Shurank#

8222#Shurank's order#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ah, once again, I have another task for you to perform. Please visit Dequ'ee in Geffen since it seems he has something to ask of you. Hurry and meet with Dequ'ee and return to me when you complete whatever it is that he wishes for you to do.#
Go to Dequ'ee#

#

8225#Dequ'ee's Reasoning#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Alright! It looks like Bankley is the murderer! Although we can't trust this 100%, this evidence is pretty conclusive. Hurry over to Morocc and monitor Bankley in case he does anything desperate. If something happens, report to me right away!#
Watch Bankley closely in Morocc#

8226#Bankley's Death#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
-He's dead! Bankley had a sad, pitiable expression on his face. Since the color is still fresh in his cheeks, he died only a little while ago. here is a long, deep wound in his chest, and a blood drenched knife is clenched in his right hand.-#
Report Bankley's Death to Dequ'ee#

8227#Return to Shurank#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Suicide...? Something shady's going on here! As for the other three suspects, I'll make sure that they're monitored by members of the Swordman Association. It looks like this case is closed for now. Once again, thanks for your help. Why don't you report back to Shurank now? I guess he still wants to show you the ropes of Swordmanship.#
Return to Shurank#

Let's find Mikhail. He says he wouldn't have been out of town #

11059#Cowardly Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
kick kick. He's an idiot and has no friends. However, if you are a villager, the owner of the ^3131FF Apple Tree Inn^000000 has said that Michael is cute.#
Let's go to the only information, the Apple Tree Inn#

11060#Cowardly Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't know if it's a guest, but I feel like I'm losing money just giving charity to travelers passing by, right? If you promise to stay overnight at our inn, I'll give you the information you want. how is it?#
Let's rest the night at the inn and ask the innkeeper about Mikhail#

11061#Mikhail the Cowardly Boy#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Maybe you've broken something precious, or your face is pale and you need a strong adhesive. What is it? There are a lot of men in the tavern, so I told them to go there.#
Mikhail seems to have gone to a tavern. Let's go to the tavern and find Mikhail#

11062#Cowardly Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't know much about glue. However, I knew someone who might know a lot about it, so I introduced him. This is the man in the corner of the bar, Viktor.#
Mikhail doesn't seem to be in the tavern. Let's ask Viktor, whom the pub master introduced, about Mikhail#

11063#Cowardly Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Alright, here's the drink you ordered. Have a good time.#
Let's have a drink and approach Viktor#

11064#Cowardly Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The material can be found in the swamps of remote areas, which require long boat rides to make strong adhesives. Could that child, who is terrified just by breaking Matryoshka, have the courage to enter that scary place?#
Where did Mikhail go? Shall we go to that swamp just in case?#

11065#Cowardly Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You can see a large swamp that makes your body feel sticky just by looking at it. The appearance of the dark bubbles bubbling up is quite frightening.#
There is no sign of someone coming. Let's go back to Mikhail's house for now.#

11066#Cowardly Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Looking around the house again, Mikhail was hiding in the hearth. Get some glue and help attach the matryoshka.#
Let's go to Viktor at the Stream Tavern to ask about the exact ingredients for the glue#

11067#Mikhail the Cowardly Boy#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
There is a large island near Moscow. From there, if you go deep into the forest, you will see a swamp. Catch 10 ^3131FF 'Swinger Grass'^000000 that grows in the swamp. Also, don't forget to bring ^3131FF medicine bowl^000000.#
Gather 10 swatter grass and return to Viktor. Don't forget to bring your medicine bowl!#

11068#Cowardly Boy Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Alright, that's it! I'm sure you gave me the glue, so I'll stop bothering you now, right? Let's go!#
Got the glue. Let's go back and tell Mikhail#

11069#Mikhail the Cowardly Boy#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Well then, I'm going to return Matryoshka to his former mother.#
Mikhail came out of the furnace. Let him go back to Gaul#

11070#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Why do you want to learn about it? Even if I wanted to teach, I'm too old to remember everything. Go find my last disciple, ^0000FF'Song Zhi Du'^000000, as he may tell you something useful.#

11071#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go do whatever you were going to do. I'm just disappointed...#
Song Zhi Du seems to be mad now. Can make him feel better by bringing something to him#

11072#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

Return to Song Zhi Du with materials he asked for#

11073#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All that's left is to create this poison, and then to get the lord of Louyang to drink it...#
Talk with him again and listen to the story, then do the favor of Song Zhi Du#

11074#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now that the fee is paid, please bring this to Song Zhi Du.#
You've obtained the material. Go back to Song Zhi Du#

11075#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
No!! I failed again! And I spent a long time preparing all of those materials...#
More materials are needed#

11076#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please sneak into the Castle of the Dragon. I want you to put this poison some place where Lord Bai Long might stay. Anyway, I'm sure my master will be happy to know that I finally created the ^0000FFpoison he wished to create^000000!#
What should I do?#

11077#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found a drink bottle that's possibly owned by Bai Long, lord of Louyang. You put the deadly poison into the bottle.#
You've done what Song Zhi Du asked for. Let's go back#

11078#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You tell Nagash Arses how Song Zhi Du created this Deadly Poison Bottle and his plan to get his revenge on the lord of Louyang.#
Looks like he needs some time alone#

11079#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I beg of you. Please do not let him bring any harm to the lord. I am pretty sure he's been asking you, as well as others, for aid... Please interrupt him from carrying out his plan.#
Get rid of the drink bottle of Bai Long#

11080#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You take the drink bottle and replace it with a bottle filled with Sticky Mucus. Hopefully Bai Long won't notice!#
Replacement Successful! Go back to Nagash Arses#

According to Clever's drawn diagram, the document doesn't seem too hidden. Rather, it seems well presented on the shelves. Look for places where books are organized in Eclage.#
Hidden historical documents (?)#

12292#The unknown ones#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Individuals responsible for constructing the Home Tree and restoring the land of Bifrost are not the Elder's Assembly, but two unknown Dona's. Ask Clever about two Donas named Etran and Robert.#
The unknown ones#

12293#Figures in history#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Clever asked to directly talk with the historical figures of the past through the rift device. Not sure if it is possible, but go visit Hiel.#
Figures in history#

12294#Tour of Eclage#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Take Robert who appeared in the past around the many places of Eclage. Wouldn't he be touched if he were to see the current state of Home Tree?#

Robert suddenly vanished. Go back to Hiel to figure out if something went wrong with the rift device.#
Error#

12296#Fun times with the reactor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Use Hiel's rift reactor to explore various areas of Eclage. There may be a place where Etran appears.#

12297#Encountering Etran#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The location where Etran can be reached was found. It would be a good chance to confirm whether he was responsible for restoring the land.#
Encountering Etran#

12298#Two wishes#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Deliver Etran's necklace to Robert. Obtain Home Tree's golden leaf. Two favors were asked. Ask Hiel about the method to obtain a Home Tree leaf.#
Two wishes#

12299#Revisiting Robert#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It is prohibited to injure Home Tree by obtaining a leaf. However, if the creator himself provides one, it may be okay. However, wasn't Robert just abandoned in front of Home Tree last time?#
Revisiting Robert#

12300#Revisitng Etran#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Show Home Tree's leaf and encourage Etran. Although Robert's refusal to receive the necklace was critical...#
Revisiting Etran#

12301#Two remaining friends#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Robert and Etran will carry out their destinies until the end. Until the land of the past (although present for them¡¦) becomes the abundant land of the present. Talk with Hiel and Clever who made the encounters possible.#

I should let Rebarev Doug know I'm ABOUT TO LEAVE, oh but first I should make sure I find out more about the FINAL MISSION.#

Ask Librarian Jekan if he has found the 1st squad's final mission's paper work. He has bad eyesight and is in need of a Magnifier and a Lantern.#
#

60724#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Librarian Jekan looks to be busy, perhaps I should just "read some documents" for awhile and then check on the shelves for until he figures out where I should check on the shelves for "The 3rd Platoon Records".#
#

60725#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jekan will need a few items to make a copy of the records. 2 Slick Paper and 1 Oil Paper from Amatsu, 3 Feather of Birds from Morocc, and 20 Blue Gems from Geffen.#
Bring these items to Jekan to make him finish the copy faster#

60726#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Your copy of the records has a weird search magic on it. To find specific info, you need to first check for broad topic then get more specific: crusader 3rd_company 3rd_platoon 1st_squad.#
Look up the individual members names to find out where they are nowadays#

60727#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Zan Huadoku inside the Geffen Blacksmith guild. Observe politeness when asking him how he is doing before jumping in to ask about their top secret final mission. Yeah, that's the ticket!#
#

60728#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zan Huadoku has told you all that you think is possible. You should head to Morocc to find "Cuaque Donon" who was last seen at the Inn. You have a feeling that you may need to be stubborn in Morocc.#
#

60729#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque Donon is in a Rogue Guild hideout probably at "Fortress Saint Darmain (South)" (use map ctrl + ~) The password to enter should be "Aragham never hoarded upgrade items".#
Cuaque is suffering from extreme PTSD and "freaks out" so pretending he is a young child would help, maybe even a dolly hahaha#

60730#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque said the squad found the "Megingjard" and an argument broke out... You need to know more about that argument, perhaps Jack.O in Alberta on the docks can help.#
He is still an active crusader, so I think talking to him will be much more straight forward#

60731#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jack.O found some relief from "Green Herb". Perhaps I should pass that advice onto the other Crusaders I meet. Emma Searth is in Aldebaran, a quick boat to Izlude and a Kafra warp to Aldebaran will have me there in a jiffy!#
Maybe I should also contemplate a memory aid for these crusaders, something to help them remember their place like a "Bookclip" from a "Rideword"#

I think I need to hurry to see "The Nineball" he works as a bouncer in the Jawaii inn. I heard there is an ex-barkeep of Jawaii working in the Central Prontera Pub maybe he knows a way to get to Jawaii without tying the knot!#
Someone named Nineball and who is a bouncer probably is pretty closed mouth kinda guy, I should keep talking until he at least reacts to my questions..#

60733#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Exit Jawaii with a Butterflywing or drink yourself back to Rune-Midgarts. Get to Comodo to see "Royal Myst" at the south casino. Morocc to Comodo is usually the easiest way to warp to Comodo.#
A "couple" of shots of "Alcohol" can loosen Royal Myst's tongue..#

60734#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've spoken to all the crusaders that are still alive, apparently something happened, blame was passed and Crusader Egnigem died in the process. You should return to Prontera Castle and inform him of your findings.#
A kafra hop from Comodo to Morocc to Prontera is quick unless you're saved in Prontera#

60735#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You should talk with the last member of the 1st squad, the late Egnigem. A Kafra hop from Prontera to Morocc to Comodo then to Umbala and then a journey north to the Tree of Life to Nifflheim can get you to him.#
Listen to Egnigem and see what you can do to fix this#

60736#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
By Odin's mercy this is terrible, you never believed that a holy Crusader would do such an evil act to claim the power of Megingjard. Be brave and return to the Crusader Headquarters and tell Max Von Shedough what you know.#
#

60737#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Max Von Shedough has accepted my report, and is deeply troubled by its contents, but part of me truly believes that despite good intentions the political reality may intervene to keep justice from being had.#
I must tell Egnigem at least of the outcome, he deserves at least to know what he died for.#

60738#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Egnigem has blessed you with all his remaining strength. You have a feeling that there is one special someone that he would want to know his fate, You must tell Emma Searth about his fate.#
#

60739#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Emma can't Remember, but she can feel the loss. Your faith in Justice is weak now... You must tell Max Von Shedough he is the Judge and he should share this burden of guilt.#
Return to Max Von Shedough at Prontera Castle#
